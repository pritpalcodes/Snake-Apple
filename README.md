# "Snake & Apple" Game

Welcome to the "Snake & Apple" game, a Python project built using the 'pygame' module. This classic game offers a great learning experience for Python beginners while incorporating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: The project is organized using classes and objects to teach OOP concepts.
- **Game Loop**: Utilizes a game loop for continuous screen updates and user input handling.
- **Collision Detection**: Implements precise collision detection for snake interactions with apples and boundaries.
- **User Input Handling**: Arrow keys control the snake's movement.
- **Scoring**: A scoring system tracks the player's progress.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python and the 'pygame' module installed.
3. Run the game by executing the 'main.py' script.
4. Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
5. Collect apples and avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Pygame

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
